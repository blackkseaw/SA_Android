## â˜• About

Our app consists of a bundle of simple educational games for children with ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder), which could help in the child's development, promoting increased apprenticeship and aid in the literacy process. Children with ASD have communication difficulties and the learning process is different, so it is important to pay attention to help their development as person. There are different types of autism: those who think and communicate through images and like to practice activities such as painting, sewing and cooking; those who think and communicate by words and facts and like to memorize excerpts from books and movie dialogues with ease; and those who think and communicate by patterns and like lego and math. Our app will help you identify the above types of autism spectrum your child has, and provide you with the tools you need to grow up a provider.
